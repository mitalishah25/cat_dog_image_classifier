# Cat and Dog Classifier
Built a 3-layer neural network to classifiy cat and dog image.  
Used Keras with Tensorflow backend to create layers for the model.  
Used publicly available dataset with 8000 trainnng images and 2000 test images each for cat and dog.  
Performed data augmentation to increase the size of the dataset to improve the accuracy.
